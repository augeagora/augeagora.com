    Currently working on making  my  own little catalog  of games
    I've played. I want to focus moreso on games I've actually poured quite
    a bit of time in or "platinumed".  While  I  could  do  this  on
    a site like backlogged I like the unrestrictiveness that comes into making
    my own little catalog.  I also think it's much more personal, which  is neat.
